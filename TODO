General project direction 

1. Load dataset 

2. Create datasets
    Healthy
    Inner race defect
    Roller element defect

        These can be labeled
        Then we can calculate F1 score etc.

3. Filter noise?

4. Extract features:
    - ["Crest Factor", 
        "RMS", 
        ¨Impulse Factor", 
        "Margin Factor", 
        "Shape Factor", 
        "Peak-Peak Value"]
    Feature selection [1]

4.1 Chunk features?
        How do we do this?
            Over each file or the entire dataset?


5. Itterate over each feature to find the best ARMA model for each feature 
    Based on AIC and BIC values select ARMA model


6. Run ARMA model for each feature for anomaly detection
    Question: How do we do this? 
    Currently: We use the model for forcasting, then we can calculate the threshold between prediction and actual?

    This has to be tested on all datasets


7. Test two Neural networks, 
    a simple autoencoder 
    and a autoencoder with LSTM

    Or maybe a simple RNN or CNN, this would propbably be more interesting.

8. Optimization
    Three options:
        Optimize dataset training speed
        Optimize model for edge 
        Optimize model hyperparameters with GA

9. Transformer
    Test two small transformers that could be evaluated on a microcontroller




10. Uncertainy pricinpel?


11. Transfer all models to Edge platform, benchmark inference speed, performance?
