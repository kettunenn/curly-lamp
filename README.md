AI/ML project for a graduate level course in optimization for industrial systems

Tested on the NASA open-source dataset found in  https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/ims-bearings

The data is formated as:

    B1_X	B1_Y	B2_X	B2_Y	B3_X	B3_Y	B4_X	B4_Y
0	-0.105	-0.017	-0.164	-0.183	-0.049	0.029	-0.115	-0.122

The repository is contains the following:

One main.py file which trains a model

In examples/ is a couple of python notebooks that explain the different steps in the process

In Report there is a short article explaining the process
